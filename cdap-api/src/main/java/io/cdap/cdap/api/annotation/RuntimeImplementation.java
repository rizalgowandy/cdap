/**
 * <p>Annotate a plugin runtime implementation that can be selected dynamically based on environment.
 * If this annotation is used, main plugin class should still implement any construction / deploy time
 * interfaces like {@link io.cdap.cdap.etl.api.PipelineConfigurable}, but during runtime first implementation
 * that is suitable for the environment out of the {@link #value()} will be used. If given implementation
 * does not work in the environment it should detect it in constructor and throw an {@link IllegalStateException}
 * to indicate it. This exception along with some other that are often produced by unsuitable environment
 * (e.g. {@link ClassNotFoundException}, {@link LinkageError}) will only be logged on debug level. Any other
 * exception will be logged as warning and other implementations will still be considered.</p>
 * <p>You can still provide default implementation in the primary plugin class, but in this case it must be
 * included in this annotation {@link #value()}. This would help to achieve backwards compatibility and
 * indicate proper runtime implementation order.
