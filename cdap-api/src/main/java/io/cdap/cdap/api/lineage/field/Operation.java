/**
 * Abstract base class to represent an Operation. Each operation has a name and description. The
 * name of operation must be unique within all operations belonging to the same program's field
 * level lineage. Operation typically has input and output fields. Input field name to the operation
 * is qualified with the name of the operation(origin) from which it was originated. It is possible
 * that the field with the same name is generated by two different operations. Now if you want to
 * use such field as an input to the next operation, qualifying the field with the origin helps to
 * uniquely identify the operation input. Outputs are given as plain field names since the name of
 * the operation is implicit in them.
