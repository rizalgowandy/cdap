/**
 * Class to support writing to log buffer and log processing pipeline(s) with high concurrency.
 *
 * It uses a non-blocking algorithm to batch writes from concurrent threads. The algorithm is the
 * same as the one used in ConcurrentMessageWriter.
 *
 * The algorithm is like this:
 *
 * When a thread that received a request, performs the following:
 *
 * <pre>
 * 1. Constructs a PendingLogBufferRequest locally and enqueue it to a ConcurrentLinkedQueue.
 * 2. Use CAS to set an AtomicBoolean flag to true.
 * 3. If successfully set the flag to true, this thread becomes the writer and proceed to run step 4-7.
 * 4. Provides an Iterator of PendingLogBufferRequest to log buffer writer, which consumes from the
 * ConcurrentLinkedQueue.
 * 5. Log buffer writer returns list of log events with file offset. These events are sent to log processor pipeline
 * for further processing.
 * 6. Set the state of each PendingLogBufferRequest that are written to COMPLETED (succeed/failure).
 * 7. Set the AtomicBoolean flag back to false.
 * 8. If the PendingLogBufferRequest enqueued by this thread is NOT COMPLETED, go back to step 2.
 * </pre>
