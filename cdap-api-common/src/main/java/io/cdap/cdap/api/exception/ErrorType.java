 * Enum representing different types of errors due to which a program can fail.

 * This enum classifies errors into three broad categories:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>SYSTEM</b> - Represents system-level errors that are typically caused by infrastructure,
 *   network, or external dependencies, rather than user actions.</li>
 *   <li><b>USER</b> - Represents errors caused by user input or actions that violate expected rules
 *   or constraints.</li>
 *   <li><b>UNKNOWN</b> - Represents errors of an indeterminate type, where the cause cannot be
 *   classified as either system or user error.</li>
 * </ul>
