/**
 * Internal batch sink used as a connector between pipeline phases. Though this extends BatchSink,
 * this will not be instantiated through the plugin framework, but will be created explicitly
 * through the application.
 *
 * The batch connector is just a PartitionedFileSet, where a partition is the name of a phase that
 * wrote to it. This way, multiple phases can have the same local PartitionedFileSet as a sink, and
 * the source will read data from all partitions.
 *
 * This is because we don't want this to show up as a plugin that users can select and use, and also
 * because it uses features not exposed in the etl api (local workflow datasets).
 *
 * TODO: improve storage format. It is currently a json of the record but that is obviously not ideal
 *
 * @param <T> type of input object
