/**
 * Groups all input objects into collections and performs an aggregation on the entire group.
 * Objects that have the same group key are placed into the same group for aggregation. When
 * possible, this interface should be used over the {@link Aggregator} interface because this
 * performs better. An {@link Aggregator} will shuffle all data across the cluster before
 * aggregating, whereas this will aggregate both before and after the shuffle. This reduces the
 * amount of data that needs to be sent over the network, as well as reducing the amount of memory
 * required to perform the aggregation.
 *
 * For example, to aggregate and compute the average for the values, the plugin will first group all
 * the values based on the group key, considering it generates following splits: Split 1: (key1, 1),
 * (key1, 2), (key1, 3), (key2, 4) Split 2: (key1, 2), (key1, 3), (key1, 4), (key2, 4) Split 3:
 * (key1, 3), (key1, 4), (key1, 5), (key2, 4)
 *
 * First, the initializeValue method will be called in each split to generate an agg value with
 * following info: (sum: value, count: num)
 *
 * The mergeValues function will be called in each split to generate following: Split 1: (key1, sum:
 * 6, count: 3), (key2, sum: 4, count: 1) Split 2: (key1, sum: 9, count: 3), (key2, sum: 4, count:
 * 1) Split 3: (key1, sum: 12, count: 3), (key2, sum: 4, count: 1)
 *
 * Data is then shuffled across the cluster such that records with the same key are handled by the
 * same executor: Split 4: (key1, sum: 6, count: 3), (key1, sum:9, count:3), (key1, sum:12, count:3)
 * Split 5: (key2, sum:4, count:1), (key2, sum:4, count:1), (key2, sum:4, count:1)
 *
 * The mergePartitions function is called to generate: Split 4: (key1, sum:27, count:9) Split 5:
 * (key2, sum:12, count:3)
 *
 * Finally, the finalize method is called to generate the final output value(s): Split 4: (key1,
 * avg: 3) Split 5: (key2, avg: 4)
 *
