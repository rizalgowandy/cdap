 * A {@link ReducibleAggregator} used in batch programs. As it is used in batch programs, a
 * BatchReducibleAggregator must be parameterized with supported group key and value classes. Group
 * keys and values can be a byte[], Boolean, Integer, Long, Float, Double, String, or
 * StructuredRecord. If the group key is not one of those types and is being used in mapreduce, it
 * must implement Hadoop's org.apache.hadoop.io.WritableComparable interface. If the group value is
 * not one of those types and is being used in mapreduce, it must implement Hadoop's
 * org.apache.hadoop.io.Writable interface. If the aggregator is being used in spark, both the group
 * key and value must implement the {@link java.io.Serializable} interface.
